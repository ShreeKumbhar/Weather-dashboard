Weather Dashboard is a web application that lets users check the current weather and a 5-day forecast for any city. It pulls weather data like temperature, humidity, and wind speed from an API. The app also offers unit conversion between Celsius and Fahrenheit and a geolocation feature to get weather based on the user's location.
